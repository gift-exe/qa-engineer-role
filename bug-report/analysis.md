# Bug Analysis: Duplicate Todo Items (Unable to Reproduce)

## Steps Attempted to Reproduce

Tested using the latest version of the app by:

1. Adding multiple todos normally
2. Rapidly pressing `Enter` after typing a todo
3. Adding todos while switching filters
4. Using different browsers (Chrome, Firefox)
5. Refreshing the app and repeating the above steps

**Result:** The duplicate todo issue could **not be reproduced**.

---

## Hypothesis

The issue may have occurred due to one of the following:

- A race condition in earlier versions of the app
- Extremely rapid input that wasn’t properly debounced
- A temporary bug introduced by a previous code change and later fixed
- Environmental causes (e.g., browser extension, slow device)

---

## Recommendation

While the issue cannot be reproduced now, to **prevent potential regressions**, we recommend:

- Implementing a debounce or input-disable mechanism during todo submission
- Improving the uniqueness of todo `id` values (e.g., use `Date.now()` with `Math.random()` or `UUID`)
- Adding a test that ensures duplicate todos are not added from rapid consecutive key presses
- Monitoring for additional user reports to help isolate patterns

---

## Regression Prevention

To ensure this doesn’t resurface in future updates:

- Include a regression test that simulates rapid Enter key presses
- Add an E2E test for normal add/delete functionality
- Set up CI to run tests automatically before deployment

---

## Status

**Conclusion:** Issue marked as **Could Not Reproduce**. No immediate action required unless re-reported or further evidence surfaces.
